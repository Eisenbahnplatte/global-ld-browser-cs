# GlobalFactSync

DBpedia, which frequently crawls and analyses over 120 Wikipedia language editions has near complete information about (1) which facts are in infoboxes across all Wikipedias (2) where Wikidata is already used in those infoboxes. GlobalFactSyncRE will extract all infobox facts and their references to produce a tool for Wikipedia editors that detects and displays differences across infobox facts in an intelligent way to help sync infoboxes between languages and/or Wikidata. The extracted references will also be used to enhance Wikidata. Click Join below to receive GFS updates via {{ping}} to your Wikiaccount.
